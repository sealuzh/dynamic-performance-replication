# Full Results

This folder contains the full results we did not show in the paper for the sake of space.

The directory [csv-results](https://github.com/sealuzh/dynamic-performance-replication/tree/master/results/csv-results) contains the comparison between pDynaMOSA and respectively the random approach (in the `first-baseline` directory) and DynaMOSA (in the `second-baseline` directory) for each of the 7 criteria investigated in RQ1 plus for the strong mutation coverage investigated in RQ2.
We report as well the results for the non adaptive approach (`non-adaptive` directory).

The directory [performance](https://github.com/sealuzh/dynamic-performance-replication/tree/master/results/performance) contains the full results about runtime and heap memory comparison. 

## CSV-Files

The csv files in this directory reports all the raw data extracted by EvoSuite ad the end of the generation process. We based all our analysis on those files.
