# Configuration Parameters

In order to foster replicability of our results, we share the [Properties.java](https://github.com/sealuzh/dynamic-performance-replication/blob/master/configuration/Properties.java) file that lists all the possible parameters ---along with their descriptions--- of EvoSuite and their default values.
Note that we mostly relied on those default parameters for our analysis. 

We list the remaining non-default values we use in our experiment in the [experiment_base.py](https://github.com/sealuzh/dynamic-performance-replication/blob/master/scripts-generation/experiments_base.py) file.
